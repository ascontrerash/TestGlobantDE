# TestGlobantDE
Repository created to store the code for the test in Globant apliccation as a Data Engineer

## Section 1
There was implemented the API with flask and python, we used SQL Alchemy for the connection and management with the database, that in this case is sqlite3(a future improvement could be implent another DBMS more robust like SQL Server or Postgress). We used the db.Model class in enhiretance with the models that we implement for the tables. 

We used the next Data Model:
![Data Model](ERD.JPG)


We defined 3 routes for this section:
+ '/' is our index and it should be used to upload the csv to the data migration
+ '/upload' that give us the information of the file that was uploaded\
+ '/insert_batch_trxs' to send the batch transactions (this method should be programmed better)

## Section 2
This section was performed in Sqlite3, and the funtions that it give us (in the future an improvement should be use a more robust DBMS to use better methods), there were two methods and routes that provides the endpoint for querying the metrics, in this methods we dipose the data as a json.

We defined 2 routes for this section:
+ '/query_metric1' return the result of the first metric
+ '/query_metric2' return the result of the second metric

### First Metric
Number of employees hired for each job and department in 2021 divided by quarter. The
table must be ordered alphabetically by department and job.

### Second Metric
‚óè List of ids, name and number of employees hired of each department that hired more
employees than the mean of employees hired in 2021 for all the departments, ordered
by the number of employees hired (descending).
